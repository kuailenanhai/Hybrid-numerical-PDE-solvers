In what follows, when we refer to a makefile, we refer to the makefile in the $PDD
dir (i.e. the top dir of the solver).

The following libraries are needed by the solver and are not distributed with it:
  deal.II 6.1.0
  gsl (GNU Scientific library)
They need to be installed and some setup is required in order for the compiler to
be able to find them.

== deal.II 6.1.0:
   - download deal.II 6.1.0
   - unzip
   - configure
   - make
   - find the variable DEALIIdir in the makefile, and point it to the top dir of
     the deal.II library
       e.g. if deal.II is here /home/john/deal.II, set DEALIIdir like this:
            DEALIIdir = /home/john/deal.II

== gsl (GNU Scientific library):
   - install gsl
   - the linking to the lib is done like this: `pkg-config --libs --cflags gsl`
     (see the makefile). if your system has pkg-config, then it will work ok, else
     interchange "`pkg-config --libs --cflags gsl`" with the flags required by your
     system to link to gsl.
       e.g. in my system,
               $ pkg-config --libs --cflags gsl
            gives the following output:
               -I/usr/local/include  -L/usr/local/lib -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm
